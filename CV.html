	<p1>The Armenian General Benevolent Union (AGBU) is the world’s largest non-profit organization devoted to preserving and promoting the Armenian identity and heritage through educational, cultural and humanitarian programs. Each year, the organization supports, serves, and connects over 500,000 individuals across Armenia, Karabakh, and the diaspora.

Through the vision of its leaders and the generous support of devoted donors and members over the years, AGBU has played a significant role in upholding Armenian traditions and values by adapting to the needs of the worldwide community and the demands of the times. Since 1906, AGBU has remained true to one overarching goal: to sustain a foundation for the benefit of all Armenians.
